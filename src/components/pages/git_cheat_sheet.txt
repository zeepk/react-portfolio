git fetch                           If you created or deleted any branches on Github, you need to fetch 
                                    the new branch tree so your IDE/Editor knows about it.

git pull                            Pulls any changes from your current branch on Github (remote) to 
                                    your current branch in your IDE/Editor (local).

git add *                           When you've made some changes and are ready to commit, this will 
                                    add any files that were changed to the 'commit waiting room' for 
                                    when you actually commit.

git commit -m "message"             Commits any added (see above) files and their changes to your local 
                                    Git repository. As of this command, they are *not* online yet, just on                
                                    your computer. Also adds whatever is in quotes to the commit for you
                                    to keep track of what you changed.

git push                            Pushes any commits made since your last 'push' to the remote branch on Github    
                                    that corresponds to the branch you are in on your computer. This changes
                                    the files on Github that everyone can see, and you can also see all of 
                                    your commit messages from the commits that were pushed.

                                    

example:                            I'm working on a project with a coworker. They added some code and I need to 
                                    update the code I am seeing to be in line with the changes they made.

                                        git pull

                                    My coworker added a new branch and I want to see it in VS Code / PyCharm and 
                                    see what is in there.

                                        git fetch

                                    I changed my navigation bar in my code and want to save it before I continue, so   
                                    if I break something, I can come back to what the code looks like right now.

                                        git add *
                                        git commit -m "made some changes to the navigation"

                                    I am happy with the way the navigation bar looks now, I have committed my changes, 
                                    and I want to update the codebase online (Github) so my team can see the new nav bar and
                                    build off of it.

                                        git push
